                     VAST employs a diffusion-based generative model orchestrated through ComfyUI to explore depth-driven facade patterning. Rather than relying on free-form prompts, the system uses structured control parameters to guide regional variation, pattern density, and depth modulation. Generated images encode spatial logic as continuous pattern fields rather than isolated textures. These outputs are interpreted through contour extraction, translating visual depth cues into explicit geometric representations. My role focused on developing the algorithmic translation from contour geometry to robotic toolpaths, designing region-based path logic that aligns fabrication constraints with generative design intent.
                        Through this translation layer, the project positions robotic path planning as an exploratory system—where generative patterns are not merely fabricated, but interrogated, restructured, and re-authored through material and machine behavior.

                <p>
                    We seek to explore how generative AI and robotic fabrication can operate as a continuous design system rather than separate stages of image-making and production. We investigate diffusion models not as tools for surface aesthetics, but as mechanisms for encoding depth, regional variation, and spatial logic within facade systems. Through the translation from generative patterns to robotic toolpaths, we aim to examine how design intent is transformed through material constraints and machine behavior. Ultimately, we frame fabrication as an active participant in the design process, shaping architectural form through interaction rather than execution.

                    <h3>Why particles</h3>
                    <p>
                        Compared to geometry, particles can represent force as flow—accumulating, dispersing, and transforming over time—creating
                        a more continuous trace of motion.
                    </p>

                    <h3>What “continuity” means here</h3>
                    <p>
                        Continuity is treated as temporal coherence—how momentum carries across frames—rather than a sequence of discrete poses.

    <h2>Technical Approach</h2>

    <div class="container">

        

        <!-- Right: Short method explanation -->
        <div class="design-language">
          <h3>1) Motion Capture as Force Input</h3>
            <p class="design-paragraph">
                Full-body gestures were captured using a Rokoko motion capture suit and processed beyond skeletal animation.
                Motion data was interpreted as vectors of directionality, momentum, and temporal continuity, describing how force flows through the body over time.
                These vectors form the energetic input that drives the system.
            </p>

        <h3>2) Force-to-Field Translation</h3>
        <p class="design-paragraph">
            Motion-derived vectors were mapped into signed distance fields that encode acceleration, flow, and spatial influence.
            Rather than discrete coordinates, movement generates a continuously evolving force landscape that shapes system behavior.
        </p>

        <h3>3) Particle Behavior as Material</h3>
        <p class="design-paragraph">
            A custom particle system responds to the force fields by adjusting velocity, turbulence, and trail behavior.
            Particles behave as if reading the dancer’s energy—swirling, clustering, stretching, or dissolving in response to expressive motion.

            <p class="design-paragraph">
            Tempo produced a computational system that visualizes motion as continuous force rather than discrete form.
            Motion capture was translated into vector and distance-based fields, allowing velocity, acceleration, and directional change to drive fluid particle behavior and time-based trails.
            Through iteration, particles proved especially effective for making continuity legible—preserving temporal coherence where geometry tends to fragment it.
