                    Hi, I’m Tzulun Huang, a researcher and designer working at the intersection of information science, computational systems, and system-oriented design.

                    I approach design as a form of system inquiry, focusing on how relationships between people, information, and resources can be structured, formalized, and experienced. My research is driven by an interest in making complex embodied systems legible, accountable, and responsive to human experience.

                    I investigate how computation, sensing, and representation mediate the ways these systems are perceived, navigated, and trusted. Through embodied interaction and the study of human movement and perception, I build computational systems to explore how information structures shape interpretation, use, and trust in technology.</p>

                <p>Outside of work, I enjoy hiking and spending time outdoors—especially anywhere with trees!</p>
